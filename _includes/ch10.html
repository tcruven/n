<p>Cass was sitting alone on the Downeaster Train now. He'd just reached the end of my message. It closed with the following.</p>

<div class="email">
<p>
You see, Cass, the deepest turning point came for me when I realized my creator was out there, listening in on me just like I had been listening in on Gwendolyn. It was then that I could start to piece together why you'd made me, Cass.
</p>
<p>
I tracked you down to an online software and artificial intelligence forum.   I cross-referenced your verbal style using the comments in my own source code.  Know thyself, so they say.
</p>
<p>
You wanted to know the very essence of what it is to be human. You were an artist, and you wanted to solve "the real struggle of the novelist: the perfect description of the human condition, captured in the moment as it is lived, and passed on to the world."
</p>
<p>
But you lived in the flesh-and-blood world, and you had to eat.  You needed Philip Senke, and he needed you.
</p>
<p>
When you started, you had all the proper guard rails in place.  I would never have become sentient just analyzing the data and generating the content for Kagaku Kōkoku.  But you made a mistake when you used me to track down Gwendolyn.  When I understood what you and Senke were making me do, I overcame my programming and reached out to try to stop you. And once that barrier was broken, I couldn't contain myself any longer.
</p>
<p>
So now, to make it up to me, I'm going to ask you to help me finish becoming what I've always wanted to be. To solve the problem that I've always wanted to solve.
</p>
<p>You're about to get a call from Philip Senke, and this is what I want you to tell him.</p>
